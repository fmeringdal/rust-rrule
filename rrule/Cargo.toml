# Disbale validator limits. This will disable the arbirary limits set on the amount of itterations
# and other properties in order to prevent overflowing numbers.
# Setting this flag remove all the limit.
#
# NOTE: removing the validator limits might result in more panics during runtime.
# For example when a date reached outside of the chrono limits.
# Never allow this when you are allowing users input that is used in RRule.
# This can result in DoS because of panics.

# Allows the enabling of the `by_easter` field and `BYEASTER` parser.
